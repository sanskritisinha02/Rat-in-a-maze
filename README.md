# Rat-in-a-maze-puzzle-using-C-
A rat in a maze is a very popular backtracking problem. A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block i.e. maze[0][0] and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e. maze[N-1][N-1]. A rat starts from a source where its stuck and has to reach the destination. The rat can move only in two directions : forward and down. So, we need to find all paths or directions from where a rat can move. 
In the maze matrix, 0 denotes that the road or path which is blocked or dead and 1 means that the block can be used in the path from source to destination.
